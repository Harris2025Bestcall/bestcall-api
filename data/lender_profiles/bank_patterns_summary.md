## adviacreditunion

Approval Trends:
- Advia Credit Union approved approximately 38% of the total applications received.
- The credit score range for approvals was 583.0 to 812.0, suggesting that the lender is more likely to approve applicants with relatively higher credit scores.

Decline Patterns:
- About 62% of the total applications were declined.
- The credit score range for declines was 508.0 to 731.0. This indicates that even applicants with credit scores that are generally considered fair (above 700) were declined.

Risk Insights:
- The advance percentage range for approvals was 56.0% to 153.0%, which is wider than the range for declines (86.0% to 152.0%). This suggests that the lender is willing to approve loans with a lower advance percentage, potentially indicating a risk-averse strategy.
- However, the fact that the lender also approves loans with an advance percentage over 100% may suggest a willingness to take on higher risk in certain cases.
- The overlap in credit scores and advance percentages between approvals and declines suggests that there may be other factors at play in the lender's decision-making process, such as income, debt-to-income ratio, or the applicant's history with the lender.

## ally

Approval Trends:
Ally approved only 7.4% of the total applications, indicating a conservative approach to lending. The credit score range for approvals was 616.0 - 793.0, suggesting that Ally favors applicants with relatively high credit scores. The advance percentage range for approvals was 74.0% - 120.0%, indicating that Ally is willing to lend a significant portion, or even more than the total value of the asset, to applicants with high credit scores.

Decline Patterns:
The vast majority of applications (92.6%) were declined. The credit score range for declines was 400.0 - 744.0, showing that Ally declined applications even from some applicants with good credit scores. The advance percentage range for declines was 78.0% - 148.0%, suggesting that a high requested advance percentage, potentially indicating a higher risk loan, could contribute to a decline, even if the applicant has a good credit score.

Risk Insights:
Ally seems to adopt a risk-averse lending strategy, favoring applicants with high credit scores and declining a high proportion of applications. However, the fact that they approve loans with an advance percentage up to 120% suggests that they are willing to take on some risk for applicants with high credit scores. The decline of applicants with credit scores up to 744 suggests that credit score alone is not the only factor in Ally's decision-making process, and other factors such as the requested advance percentage or the applicant's debt-to-income ratio may also play a significant role.

## allyclearlanepassautoforward

Approval Trends: There were no approvals made by the lender allyclearlanepassautoforward, so it's not possible to identify any approval trends.

Decline Patterns: The lender declined all 173 applications. The credit scores of the declined applicants ranged from 400 to 731. This suggests that the lender has a high standard for credit scores or there may be other factors at play that are causing the declines. The advance percentage for these declined applications ranged from 78% to 152%, suggesting that the lender might be cautious about high advance rates.

Risk Insights: The lender seems to be very risk-averse, as indicated by the lack of approvals and the range of credit scores for the declined applications. The high range of advance percentages in the declined applications may suggest that the lender perceives these as high risk. However, without additional data on the lender's criteria or the specifics of the applications, it's difficult to draw more detailed conclusions. It would be beneficial to understand the lender's decision-making process better to provide more accurate insights.

## americredit

Approval Trends:
- Americredit approved 21.5% of the total applications, suggesting a relatively stringent approval process.
- The credit score range for approved applications is between 520 and 684, indicating that the lender is willing to approve applicants with relatively lower credit scores.
- The advance percentage for approved loans ranges from 66% to 126%, suggesting that the lender is willing to approve loans that exceed the value of the collateral in some cases.

Decline Patterns:
- Americredit declined 78.5% of the total applications, indicating a high rejection rate.
- The credit score range for declined applications is between 400 and 731. This wide range suggests that credit score alone is not the sole determinant for loan approval.
- The advance percentage for declined loans ranges from 81% to 148%. This indicates that a high advance percentage could be a potential reason for loan rejection.

Risk Insights:
- The overlap in credit score ranges between approved and declined applications suggests that Americredit considers other factors beyond credit score in their decision-making process.
- The lender's willingness to approve loans with an advance percentage over 100% could potentially increase their risk exposure. However, this risk may be mitigated by other factors such as the applicant's income or the type of collateral.
- The high decline rate may suggest a conservative lending approach, which could potentially reduce the risk of defaults. However, this could also lead to missed opportunities with potential borrowers.

## calautomotive

Approval Trends:
Calautomotive approved 40% of the total applications. All approved applications had a credit score of 738, which suggests that the lender has a high credit score threshold for approval. The advance percentage for approved applications was consistently 77%.

Decline Patterns:
60% of the total applications were declined. The credit score range for declined applications was 621 to 698, indicating that the lender is not approving applications with credit scores in this range. The advance percentage for declined applications ranged from 78% to 80%.

Risk Insights:
Calautomotive seems to be risk-averse, as indicated by their high credit score threshold for approval. They appear to decline applications with slightly higher advance percentages (78%-80%) compared to approved ones (77%), suggesting that they might perceive a higher risk with higher advance percentages. However, the difference in advance percentages between approved and declined applications is minimal, indicating that credit score might be a more significant factor in their decision-making process.

## capitalone

Approval Trends:
CapitalOne approved 30.88% of the total applications. The credit score range for approvals was quite wide, from 480.0 to 820.0, indicating that the lender is willing to approve loans for applicants with a variety of credit scores. The advance percentage range for approvals was also broad, from 65.0% to 145.0%, suggesting that the lender is flexible in terms of the amount they are willing to advance.

Decline Patterns:
The lender declined 69.12% of the total applications. The credit score range for declines was from 400.0 to 731.0. This shows that even applicants with relatively high credit scores were declined. The advance percentage range for declines was from 78.0% to 148.0%, indicating that the decision to decline was not solely based on the amount requested.

Risk Insights:
The overlap in credit score ranges and advance percentages for both approvals and declines suggests that the lender's decision may not be solely based on these two factors. There might be other factors at play, such as the applicant's income, employment status, or debt-to-income ratio. The fact that some applicants with relatively high credit scores were declined could indicate a risk-averse approach by the lender. The wide range of advance percentages for both approvals and declines suggests that the lender is flexible in terms of the amount they are willing to advance, but also careful about overextending credit.

## consumerportfolioservices

Approval Trends:
Consumer Portfolio Services approved approximately 28% of the total applications. The credit scores of the approved applicants ranged from 468 to 672, indicating that the lender is willing to approve loans for applicants with relatively low credit scores. The advance percentage for approved loans ranged from 81% to 125%, suggesting that the lender is also willing to approve loans that exceed the value of the collateral.

Decline Patterns:
The lender declined approximately 72% of the total applications. The credit scores of the declined applicants ranged from 400 to 717. This wide range suggests that credit score alone may not be the deciding factor for loan approval. The lender declined loans with an advance percentage ranging from 102% to 133%, indicating a possible reluctance to approve loans with high advance percentages.

Risk Insights:
The lender seems to be taking on a significant amount of risk by approving loans for applicants with low credit scores and high advance percentages. However, the high decline rate suggests that the lender is also cautious and considers other factors in addition to credit score and advance percentage when making lending decisions. It would be beneficial to investigate what these other factors might be to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the lender's decision-making process.

## creditacceptance

The lender, Creditacceptance, has a 100% approval rate as per the data provided. This is based on a single application, which was approved. The credit score of the approved application was 607, indicating that the lender may be willing to approve loans for applicants with moderate credit scores. 

The advance percentage for the approved loan was 118%, suggesting that the lender may be willing to offer loans that exceed the requested amount. 

However, as there were no declined applications, it's not possible to determine a pattern or trend in the lender's decline decisions or to identify any associated risk factors. 

It's important to note that these insights are based on very limited data - only one application. A larger dataset would provide a more accurate understanding of the lender's decision patterns and risk tolerance.

## crescentbank

Approval Trends:
- The lender, Crescentbank, has an approval rate of approximately 39% (41 out of 105 applications).

Decline Patterns:
- The decline rate is approximately 61% (64 out of 105 applications).

Risk Insights:
- The bank seems to be taking on significant risk by approving loans for applicants with low credit scores. However, the risk might be mitigated by other factors not included in the data, such as collateral or income level.
- The bank is declining some applications from individuals with high credit scores, which could suggest a conservative approach to risk, or that other factors (like high advance percentages or lack of collateral) are contributing to the decision.
- The wide range of advance percentages in both approved and declined applications suggests that this factor is not a primary determinant in the decision-making process. However, the higher range in declined applications indicates that a high advance percentage could increase the risk of decline.

## exeterfinance

Approval Trends:
Exeterfinance has approved approximately 46% of the total applications. The credit scores of approved applicants range from 411 to 695, indicating that the lender is willing to approve loans for applicants with relatively low credit scores.

Decline Patterns:
Approximately 54% of the total applications were declined. The credit scores of declined applicants range from 400 to 723. This shows that even applicants with relatively high credit scores were declined, suggesting that credit score is not the sole factor in the lender's decision-making process. The advance percentage for declined loans ranges from 16% to 110%, indicating that the lender is cautious about advancing higher percentages, even if the credit score is decent.

Risk Insights:
The lender seems to be taking on significant risk by approving applicants with low credit scores and advancing high percentages of the loan amount. However, they also decline applicants with high credit scores and lower advance percentages, indicating that they might be considering other factors such as income stability, debt-to-income ratio, or the applicant's credit history in their decision-making process. The lender's decision pattern suggests a complex risk assessment strategy beyond just credit scores and advance percentages.

## globallendingservices

- Globallendingservices has an approval rate of approximately 61.4% (97 out of 158 applications).
- The credit score range for approved applications is quite wide, from 400.0 to 731.0. This suggests that the lender is willing to approve loans to applicants with a variety of credit histories, including those with lower scores.

Risk Insights:
- The overlapping credit score ranges for approvals and declines suggest that the lender is not solely relying on credit scores to make lending decisions. Other factors, such as income level, employment status, or debt-to-income ratio, may also be significant.
- The fact that the lender is willing to approve advances greater than 100% suggests a higher risk tolerance, as this could potentially lead to higher default rates.
- The wide range of advance percentages for both approvals and declines suggests that the lender is flexible but also potentially inconsistent in their lending decisions. This could indicate a lack of a clear lending strategy or risk assessment process.

## gofi,llc

Approval Trends:
Gofi, LLC approved only one out of the three total applications, indicating a 33.3% approval rate. The approved application had a credit score of 679, suggesting that the lender may prefer applicants with a relatively high credit score. The approved loan had an advance percentage of 83.0%, indicating that the lender might be more inclined to approve loans that do not exceed this percentage.

Decline Patterns:
The lender declined two applications, accounting for 66.7% of the total applications. These declined applications had credit scores ranging from 530 to 580, suggesting that the lender might consider this range as a high-risk credit score range. The declined loans had an advance percentage ranging from 108.0% to 121.0%, indicating that the lender might be less likely to approve loans that exceed a certain percentage.

Risk Insights:
The data suggests that Gofi, LLC perceives applications with lower credit scores (530-580) and higher advance percentages (108.0% - 121.0%) as riskier. Conversely, the lender seems to perceive applications with higher credit scores (679) and lower advance percentages (83.0%) as less risky. This could indicate a conservative lending approach, where the lender prefers to minimize risk by favoring applicants with higher credit scores and lower loan amounts relative to their income.

## stellantisfinancialservices

Based on the data provided, Stellantis Financial Services has a loan approval rate of approximately 35.6% (84 out of 236 applications), while the decline rate is approximately 64.4% (152 out of 236 applications).

The credit score range for approvals is 463.0 to 820.0, which is quite broad. This suggests that Stellantis Financial Services is willing to approve loans for applicants with a wide range of credit scores, including those with relatively low scores. 

On the other hand, the credit score range for declines is 400.0 to 793.0. This indicates that even applicants with relatively high credit scores can be declined. This suggests that credit score is not the sole factor in Stellantis Financial Services' decision-making process, and other factors such as income, debt-to-income ratio, or loan-to-value ratio may also play significant roles.

The advance percentage range for approvals is 54.0% to 153.0%, while for declines it is 56.0% to 148.0%. This implies that the company is willing to approve loans that exceed the value of the collateral (over 100% advance), which can be considered a risky practice. However, it also declines loans with advance percentages that are both lower and higher than the approval range, indicating that this factor is also not the sole determinant of the decision.

In terms of risk insights, the fact that Stellantis Financial Services is willing to approve loans with low credit scores and high advance percentages suggests a higher risk tolerance. However, the high decline rate indicates a balanced approach to risk management. It would be beneficial to analyze additional factors such as the applicants' income, employment status, and loan purpose to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the company's risk profile and decision-making process.

## stellantisfinancialservices,inc.

Approval Trends:
Stellantis Financial Services, Inc. has a high approval rate with 77.37% of total applications being approved. The credit score range for approvals is quite wide, from 573 to 869, indicating that the lender is willing to approve loans for applicants with a broad range of credit scores. This could suggest a flexible lending policy. The advance percentage range for approvals is also wide, from 61% to 120%, indicating that the lender is willing to approve loans that cover a significant portion of the cost of the asset being financed.

Decline Patterns:
The decline rate is relatively low at 22.63% of total applications. The credit score range for declines is also wide, from 545 to 836. Interestingly, this range overlaps with the approval credit score range, suggesting that credit score alone may not be the sole determinant in the lender's decision to decline an application. The advance percentage range for declines is narrower, from 67% to 107%. This could indicate that the lender is less likely to approve loans that cover a smaller or larger portion of the cost of the asset being financed.

Risk Insights:
The lender appears to be willing to take on a fair amount of risk, as evidenced by the approval of applications with lower credit scores and higher advance percentages. However, the overlap in credit score ranges for approvals and declines suggests that the lender may also be considering other factors, such as income, debt-to-income ratio, or employment status, in their decision-making process. The narrower advance percentage range for declines could also indicate a cautious approach to lending beyond certain limits.

## teachersfederalcreditunion

Approval Trends:
The approval rate for teachersfederalcreditunion is relatively low, with only about 10.34% of total applications being approved. Applicants with credit scores ranging from 705 to 720 are more likely to get approved.

Decline Patterns:
The majority of applications, approximately 89.66%, were declined. The credit scores of declined applicants ranged widely from 554 to 744. This suggests that credit score alone may not be the only determining factor in the decision to decline. The advance percentage for declined loans also varied significantly, ranging from 78% to 136%. This indicates that even applicants seeking less than the value of their collateral were declined, as well as those seeking significantly more.

Risk Insights:
The data suggests that teachersfederalcreditunion is a conservative lender, with a low approval rate and a relatively high credit score requirement for approval. The wide range of credit scores and advance percentages among declined applicants suggests that the lender may be considering other factors in their decision-making process, such as income, employment stability, or debt-to-income ratio. The fact that loans were declined even when the advance percentage was less than 100% may indicate a cautious approach to risk management.

## universityofmichigancu

Decline Patterns:

- The credit score range for declined applications is between 576 and 793. This shows that even applicants with a fairly good credit score (793) can be declined.
- The advance percentage for declined applications ranges from 78% to 148%. This suggests that applications are likely to be declined if the loan amount is significantly higher than the collateral value, especially beyond 129%.

Risk Insights:
- The lender seems to be risk-averse as they prefer applicants with high credit scores and are less likely to approve loans that are significantly higher than the collateral value.
- However, the lender is taking on some risk by approving loans that exceed the collateral value, up to 129%.
- The lender's decision pattern suggests that they are balancing between risk and reward, leaning towards safer lending practices but still accommodating some level of risk.

## usbank

Approval Trends:
- Out of 33 total applications, usbank approved 13, which is approximately 39% of the total applications.
- The credit score range for approvals is between 668 and 834. This suggests that usbank tends to approve applications with relatively high credit scores.

Decline Patterns:
- The bank declined 20 applications, which is approximately 61% of the total applications.
- The credit score range for declines is between 536 and 744. This indicates that usbank is likely to decline applications with lower credit scores, but it also declines some applications with credit scores that fall within the lower end of the approval range.

Risk Insights:
- The advance % range for approvals is between 81% and 109%. This suggests that usbank is willing to approve advances that are slightly above 100% of the requested amount for applicants with high credit scores.
- The advance % range for declines is between 78% and 126%. This indicates that usbank is more likely to decline advances that exceed the requested amount by a significant margin, even for applicants with credit scores that fall within the approval range. This could be a risk mitigation strategy to avoid overextending credit.
- There is an overlap in the credit score range for approvals and declines (668-744), which suggests that credit score alone does not determine the approval or decline of an application. Other factors, such as the advance % requested, may also play a significant role in the decision-making process.
