  "recommendation_summary": "As a finance assistant, I would recommend the following:\n\nSince the approval structure is currently incomplete (with no estimated approval amount, Max LTV, Term, or Tier Suggestion specified) and no vehicle in our current inventory fits the unspecified approval structure, we are unable to proceed with a deal recommendation at this time.\n\nThe best course of action at this stage would be to gather more information from the customer about their financing needs and credit profile. With this information at hand, we will be able to provide a detailed and suitable approval structure, which could be used to match a vehicle within or outside our current inventory. Proceeding this way will help us ensure we find the best potential vehicle deal for the customer based on their specific financial circumstances."
